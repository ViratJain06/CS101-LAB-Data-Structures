In the code firstly in (a) part of the program it reads the text file and scan the inputs from the text file and stores it in an array.
In the (b) part of the program it allocates the memory for the integer and reallocates memory for every input untill the end of file occurs or the user presses enter.
In function 1 firstly it creates a cumulative sum array of the array passed by reference in the function then it updates the index according to query one along with the variable used in
calculating the time. then it gives the particular index from cumulatibve array until which the sum was required along with the time variables to calculate time.
Similarly in function 2 first it creates the binary index tree of the given array and then update the given index in an array it also calculates the sum with the help of contributing terms 
along with the time variables to calculate time taken per query.
