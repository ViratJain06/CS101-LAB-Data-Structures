1)firstly Creating a struct node for nodes and type defining it as node.
2)first function allocates memory and makes a new node.
3)second function returns height of particular node by recursively calculation height of left and right subtree.
4)third function calculates the balance factor of the node using height function.
5)fourth function left rotate the avl tree with balance factor more than one.
6)similarly fifth function right rotates the tree by just connection of nodes
7)sixth function performs left right rotation using the left rotate and right rotate function.
8)seventh function performs right right rotation using the left rotate and right rotate function.
9)the Insert function inserts the value in tree and then balance using different rotation according to the balance factor.
10)the Search function searches the element in the tree just like we search in binary search tree.
11)next function is for preorder traversal.
12)last function is for inorder traversal.
