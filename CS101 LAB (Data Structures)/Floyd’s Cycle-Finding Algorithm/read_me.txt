1)In the program I first created a function to create a straight linked list of length n which the user will input. 
In it I used a for loop for forming new nodes and connecting it with the previous nodes.
2)The second function created a linked list with a cycle of length l which user will input and distance of head from start is c taken as parameters.
In it I created a straight linked list and stored the address of start node and then connect the last node with the start of cycle node.
3)The third function is for printing the linked list.it is just for checking purpose.
4)The fourth function detects the cycle using the floyds algorithm of fast and slow pointer.
5)In the last function after the fast and slow pointer is equal I finded the length of cycle by moving one pointer accross the cycle.
After i point one pointer towards head node and move both the pointer by one step to detect the start of cycle.
